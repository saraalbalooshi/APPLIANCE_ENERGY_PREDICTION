#  <font style='color:skyblue'> PROJECT TITLE: APPLIANCE ENERGY PREDICTIONS 

---

## <font style='color:skyblue'>  Abstract <a id='section-1'></a> 


Energy consumption is rapidly increasing globally, leading to energy scarcity and environmental damage. This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the rising energy consumption of home appliances, explore methods to reduce this consumption, and predict energy usage using regression models. The challenge involves supervised machine learning to predict appliance energy usage based on factors like temperature, humidity, and pressure. Various algorithms, including linear regression, have been employed for energy consumption prediction.
## <font style='color:skyblue'>  Problem Statement <a id='section-2'></a>
The dataset consists of 10-minute intervals spanning around 4.5 months. It encompasses temperature and humidity readings from a ZigBee wireless sensor network within the house, along with energy consumption data recorded every 10 minutes through m-bus energy meters. Additionally, weather information sourced from Chievres Airport, Belgium, via Reliable Prognosis, has been integrated into the dataset.
